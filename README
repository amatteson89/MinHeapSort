Included with these files is a 'makefile'

To compile and run the code to to make the random number file
	Type the following and hit enter
	1. make random
	2. ./randomGen

To compile the main algorithm:
	Traverse your terminal (assuming some sort of linux distro is used) to the source code folder
 type the following then hit enter
	1. make
	2. ./a.out

Note: 
	You need the random number file for the main program to run.
	I personally changed the size of my number file every time and re ran the random number generator file.
